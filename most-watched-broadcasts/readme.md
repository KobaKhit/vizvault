**New Additions:**

  - This is a follow up to [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1aomos2/oc_most_watched_broadcasts_in_the_us_will). I added the preliminary viewership data for Super Bowl LVIII and a few additional visuals.

  - Based on /u/UX_Strategist feedback added color legend.

  - Based on /u/Deinococcaceae and many others added avg viewers as percent of population metric.

**Updated Notes**:

  - 23 out of 31 most watched programs in the US #TV history are #Superbowl broadcastsüèà.

  - Michael Jackson's Halftime Show was watched by more people than the Superbowl #XXVII itself (102 vs 91 million average viewers). Truly the King of Pop.

  - Creating complex subplots in Plotly becomes really tedious, especially, when trying to align everything. Plotly does not allow using figures as subplots, so I had to use ipywidgets to display graphs side by side.
